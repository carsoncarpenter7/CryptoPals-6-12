**IF** code raises error for Challenge 7 simply comment out lines 63 and 64 in crypto.py to test other challenges. I have tested this code on Linux and is executing fine however I tested it on my mac as well and it raises an error. I provided a screenshot of the code executing on my end within the submitted files. 

NOTE: I attempted to make a requirements.txt for my virtual environment
but led to conflict when executing my code and imports. Installing pycryptodome should be the only requirement of the system. If you have any trouble when executing please let me know.
